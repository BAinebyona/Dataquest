In this repository I highlight some of the projects I have done as part of continous learning on <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/"> dataquest </a>
Projects are grouped under typical dataquest learning paths.

## Data Analysis and Visualization with Python
1. Analysing Helicopter prison breaks.  
    I scrape helicopter prison break attempts from a table on <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes'>wikipedia</a> using `requests` library. I then use BeautifulSoup to extract data, clean some of the columns using regular pattern (`regex`). I then use the data to answer questions like: 
     - which country has had the most helicopter escape attempts
     - which decade had the most helicopter escape attempts and what is the trend with time
     - Is there a relationship between the number of escapees and whether the attempt was successful or not?
