In this project, I scrape helicopter prison break attempts from a table on <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes'>wikipedia</a> using `requests` library. I then use BeautifulSoup to extract data, clean some of the columns using regular pattern (`regex`).  

I use the data to answer the following questions:
- which country has had the most helicopter escape attempts
- which decade had the most helicopter escape attempts and what is the trend with time?
- Is there a relationship between the number of escapees and whether the attempt was successful or not?
